# SortingVisualizer

This is a simple sorting visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by showing each step of the sorting process visually. Code snippets are also shown below the animation to make it easier to follow along.

## Access the Project

You can check out the project here: https://github.com/SathvikNarayana28/SortingVisualizer.git

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to make learning sorting algorithms easier and more interactive. By seeing how each algorithm sorts an array step by step, users can better understand the logic behind it. This is especially useful for beginners who are just getting started with algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structuring the page  
- CSS for styling  
- JavaScript for handling the sorting logic and animations

## Features

- Visual representation of how sorting algorithms work  
- Includes Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort  
- Code snippets are shown below the visualizer to help users understand the implementation  
- Users can generate a random array, choose a sorting algorithm, and reset the array

## Purpose

This project is mainly meant for students or anyone learning sorting algorithms. It makes it easier to understand and compare different techniques in a fun and interactive way.
